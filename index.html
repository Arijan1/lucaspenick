He showed not only the structure of the test and what it covered, but also knew how to teach it in a way that was best for me to pick up an understanding of the material. His style was extremely helpful and adaptive, and taught me in a way that I could understand and actually learn. He had tons of tricks and tools not shown in the 
                  books that increased my score
                   and lowered the time I needed to study. Absolutely very helpful</p>

The LSAT seems less intimidating and he gives you that inspiration to push and to know you can do it!
