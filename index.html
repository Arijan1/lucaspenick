                      Lucas helped me raise my LSAT score 23 points from my
                      diagnostic to taking the actual test (I believe the
                      average score increase that most test companies advertise
                      is around 10 points). I credit Lucas as a major reason why
                      I will be able to attend the UNC School of Law in the
                      fall.

                      Lucas was extremely helpful in every aspect of this
                      course. He showed not only the structure of the test and
                      what it covered, but also knew how to teach it in a way
                      that was best for me to pick up an understanding of the
                      material. His style was extremely helpful and adaptive,
                      and taught me in a way that I could understand and
                      actually learn. He had tons of tricks and tools not shown
                      in the books that increased my score and lowered the time
                      I needed to study. Absolutely very helpful

                      Classroom interaction has been perfect. Mr. Penick goes
                      over things we couldn't get on our own. Prior to the class
                      I had no idea how to prepare for games, arguments, or
                      reading comprehension, but now I feek like I've gained a
                      lot of knowledge that I'm sure is going to help me for the

            I offer a full range of private tutoring, including ACT, PSAT, and
            SAT, the FCAT, and every K-12 academic subject. I also tutor for
            graduate and professional school exams including DAT, GMAT, GRE,

            How much experience do you have as a tutor?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            I have worked extensively with thousands of students of all ages and
            background for 35 years. My students gained admission to virtually
            every college or university in the country, including each of the
            Ivy League schools.

          <div class="question">What sets your tutoring approach apart?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            My goal is to transform students' learning approaches, moving from a
            simplistic mindset to a more mature and strategic one. I focus not
            only on test preparations but also on teaching valuable study
            skills, time management, and self-awareness techniques.

            I hold a degree from the University of Chicago and am a National
            Merit Scholar. I have consistently scored in the 99th percentile on
            the exams I teach.
